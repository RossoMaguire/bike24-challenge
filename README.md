## The rules

- You have one week to complete the task at your own pace

- Please avoid a single commit at the end, we are also interested in the commit history :)

- The visualization above is just a suggestion, it's up to you to implement it according to your imagination

- Try to work through the tasks in their order and refine the final result with each new requirement

- You can use libraries, but maybe we ask why exactly this one

- Provide your code as a runnable application in the repository

- Typescript is mandatory

_Hint: You will find the products in the data folder_

## The task

_Try to imagine a wild product owner approaching you and wanting to improve the shopping experience for our customers. The following requirements are specified_

- ~~As a customer I want to be able to select products from the drop down list.~~

- ~~As a customer I would like to be able to see the prices in the drop down list.~~

- ~~As a customer I would like to be able to determine the quantity of the product before I add it to the shopping cart.~~

- ~~As a customer I would like to be informed when I exceed the maximum number of products and be prevented from entering more than this number~~

- ~~As a customer I would like to see the total for the selected product before I add it to the shopping cart~~

- ~~As a customer I want to be able to see all my products in the shopping cart~~

- ~~As a customer I want to be able to see the total of the shopping cart at any time~~

- ~~As a customer I want to be able to remove products from the shopping cart~~

- ~~As a customer I would like to be able to delete the entire shopping cart at once~~

- ~~As a customer I want to be able to see how many shopping cart items I can add (max 10 items, not product amount combined)~~

- ~~As a customer I would like to be informed when I have reached the limit~~

- ~~As a customer I want to see a graphical overlay when I confirm the purchase to know that my order was successful~~

&nbsp;
&nbsp;

## Extended scope

- ~~As a customer I want to be able to select the quantity of products with a slider~~

- ~~As a customer I want to be able to see the quantity selected with the slider also in the input field~~

- ~~As a customer I want to see the new total for the selected quantity only after a few milliseconds~~
